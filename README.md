## Data collection

### How to use

Follow these steps:

1. **Clone repo**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/saridormi/commits_dataset.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ``` 

3. **Provide repos to collect data from**

    We used [GitHub Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04682) to select repositories that meet several criteria *(you can look through [`choosing_repos.ipynb`](notebooks/choosing_repos.ipynb) for more information on our specific criteria)*.

    <summary>:yellow_heart: click here for more information about expected data format</summary>
   
    > :exclamation: Repositories are pre-split on parts *(in our case, train/val/test)*.
    > 
    > It doesn't matter for collection script, but having part called `train` is **necessary for correct work of processing script**.
   
    The script expects data to be stored in the following way:

   ```
         â”œâ”€â”€ ...  # data directory
         â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part_1
         â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ repo_1.json
         â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
         â”‚   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ repo_n.json
         â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
         â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part_k
         â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

   Information about each repo is stored in its own json file and should include the following keys:
   - `"repo"`: full repository name
   - `"url"`: repository URL
   - `"hashes"`: hashes of specific commits; only these commits are collected
   
   An example:

   ```
      {
       'repo': 'saridormi/commits_dataset',
       'url': 'https://github.com/saridormi/commits_dataset.git',
       'hashes': ['a7fb3b64184f0af5b08285cce14b9139baa94049']
      }
   ```
   </details>

5. **Define configuration**

      Configuration is defined at [`configs/collect_data.yaml`](configs/collect_data.yaml).

      <details>
      <summary>:yellow_heart: click here for more information about possible options</summary>
   
      Basically, config looks like that:

      ```
      data_format: ...
      n_workers: ...
      org_repo_sep: ...
   
      repo_processor:
         chunksize: ...
   
      pydriller_kwargs:
        ...
   
      paths: ...
          temp_clone_dir: ...
          input_dir: ...
          output_dir: ...
      ```

      * `data_format`: format to use for reading & writing data; currently, only `jsonl` is supported
      * `n_workers`: # of threads for data collection
      * `org_repo_sep`: smth to replace `/` in `"org/repo"`      

      * `repo_processor`
        * `chunksize`: # of examples in single data chunk (large files are processed in chunks)

      * `pydriller_kwargs`:
      
        All keyword arguments under this key are passed to PyDriller's `RepositoryMining`. 
      See [PyDriller documentation](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/en/1.15/reference.html#pydriller.repository_mining.RepositoryMining) for more information.
      
      * `paths`:
      
        Paths are moved to separate key to convert them all to absolute paths via hydra.
        * `temp_clone_dir`: directory remote repos will be cloned to
        * `input_dir`: directory to read data about repos from
        * `output_dir`: directory to save gathered data to
        </details>

6. **Collect data**

    To start collecting data, run the following command:
    ```
    python -m src.collect_data
    ```

### Data format

<details>
   <summary>:yellow_heart: click here for more information about collected data format</summary>
     
   Currently, data is saved in JSON Lines format. Information about each commit includes the following keys:

   - `"author"`: commit author (name, email)
   - `"date"`: commit timestamp (in format `"%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S"`)
   - `"hash"`: commit hash
   - `"message"`: commit message
   - `"mods"`: list of files modifications in commit
     - Each modification is a dictionary itself and includes the following keys:
       - `"change_type"`: one of `"ADD"`, `"COPY"`, `"RENAME"`, `"DELETE"`, `"MODIFY"` or `"UNKNOWN"`
       - `"old_path"`: old path to file
       - `"new_path"`: new path to file
       - `"diff"`: file diff
   - `"repo"`: full repository name
   
   [An example:](https://github.com/saridormi/commits_dataset/commit/a7fb3b64184f0af5b08285cce14b9139baa94049)

   ```
   {
     'author': ['Aleksandra Eliseeva', 'xxx@email.com'],
     'date': '05.07.2021 15:10:07',
     'hash': 'a7fb3b64184f0af5b08285cce14b9139baa94049',
     'message': 'Add license badge to readme',
     'mods': [{'change_type': 'MODIFY',
               'diff': '@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\n'
                       ' # Commits dataset\n'
                       ' \n'
                       '-> :heavy_exclamation_mark: **TODO:** license\n'
                       '+![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/saridormi/commits_dataset?style=for-the-badge)\n'
               'new_path': 'README.md',
               'old_path': 'README.md'}],
     'repo': 'saridormi/commits_dataset'
   }
   ```

   First, commits from each repo are saved to its own file and zipped, so folder structure looks like this:
 
   ```
      â”œâ”€â”€ ...  # output folder
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part_1
      â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ repo_1.jsonl.gz
      â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
      â”‚   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ repo_n.jsonl.gz
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part_k
      â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

   At the end commits from each part are united to single files, so folder structure looks like this:
   ```
      â”œâ”€â”€ ...  # output folder
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part_1.jsonl
      â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part_k.jsonl
      â””â”€â”€ ...
   ```

   Currently, script doesn't remove the former version, you should do it manually if you don't need raw data.

## Data processing

### How to use

> :star2: Start from step 4 if you've used the script for data collection.

Follow these steps:

1. **Clone repo**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/saridormi/commits_dataset.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Provide data**

    > :exclamation: Several processing stages treat `train` part different from others,
    so having part called `train` is necessary for correct work of processing script.
   
    Processing script expects input data to be stored in the same format collection script saves it. See all the details above,
    at [data format](#data-format) section.

4. **Define configuration**

    Configuration is defined at [`configs/process_data.yaml`](configs/process_data.yaml).   

    <details>
      <summary>:yellow_heart: click here for more information about possible options</summary>
      
      Basically, config looks like that:

      ```
      data_format: ...
   
      outliers_processor:
         ...
   
      message_processor:
         ...
   
      diff_processor:
         ...
   
      lexer:
         ...
      
      pre_deduplication_processor:
         ...
   
      post_deduplication_processor:
         ...
   
      final_processor:
         ...
   
      paths:
         input_dir: ...
         licenses_dir: ...
         tokens_percentile_dir: ...
         literals_percentile_dir: ...
         deduplication_dir: ...
      ```
   
      * `data_format`: format to use for reading & writing data; currently, only `jsonl` is supported
      * `clones_ready`: boolean, stops after `pre_deduplication_processor` stage if set to `False`
      * `paths`:
      
        Paths are moved to separate key to convert them all to absolute paths via hydra.
        * `input_dir`: directory to read data from
        * `licenses_dir`: directory to read repository-license mapping from
        * `tokens_percentile_dir`: directory to save percentiles for # tokens
        * `literals_percentile_dir`: directory to save percentiles for literals lengths
        * `deduplication_dir`: directory to save clone search results

      Each processor accepts two keyword arguments:
      * `chunksize`: # of examples in single data chunk (large files are processed in chunks) (optional, default value is 1000)
      * `n_workers`: # of threads for data processing (optional, default value is 1)
   
      Some processors also accept other keywords arguments:
      * `outliers_processor`:
        * `lower_percentile`: # tokens percentile to use as lower bound (should be in (0, 1) range)
        * `upper_percentile`: # tokens percentile to use as upper bound (should be in (0, 1) range)
        * `diff_upper_bound`: constant upper bound for # tokens in diffs (optional)
      * `lexer`:
        * `upper_percentile`: literals' lengths percentile to use as upper bound (should be in (0, 1) range)
        * `sep_char`: character to use as a delimiter between lexemes (important: should be a single character)
   </details>
    
5. **Process data**

    To start processing data, run the following command:

    ```
    python -m src.process_data
    ```
   
    Note that the script above doesn't include deduplication. When you have files with ids of duplicated entries ready, 
    run the following command:
    
    ```
    python -m src.drop_clones
    ```

### Stages

> :star2: work in progress: this section will contain a more detailed description of processing stages

## Training tokenizer

This repo also contains code for training custom tokenizer on diffs from collected data
via [ðŸ¤— Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/tokenizers/) library.

> :exclamation: Custom lexer class is used for pre-tokenization. Currently, instead of actually splitting input 
> on tokens, it inserts special delimiter.
> Tokenizer is then trained (and saved) with 
> [CharDelimiterSplit](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/v0.9.4/components.html#pre-tokenizers) pre-tokenizer
> on this delimiter.
